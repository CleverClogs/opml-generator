opml-generator
==============

An App Engine app that generates OPMLs from spreadsheets.

With much gratitude to girl geek @PamelaFox, this is my first attempt at forking someone else's Github repository. In fact, I haven't touched a programming language in 25 years, so this is an exciting experiment for me.

Check the master git at https://github.com/pamelafox/opml-generator.

The goal of this fork is to extract data from a published Google Spreadsheet and convert that into an Google Custom Search Engine.
